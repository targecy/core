# BACKGROUND

This document provides a high-level overview of the digital marketing landscape that Targecy operates within, the unique challenges it aims to solve, and an introduction to our innovative approach.

## Digital Marketing Context

In the early 2000s, traditional advertising mediums like print, radio, and television dominated the market. However, the rise of the internet and digital technologies shifted the landscape significantly, leading to digital advertising surpassing traditional forms by 2021, accounting for 65% of total ad spending. This era saw the emergence of centralized digital advertising platforms controlled by giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, capturing over 60% of the global market. Despite their reach, these platforms raised concerns over transparency, privacy, and high fees, leading to stringent regulations like GDPR and CCPA, ad-blockers and browsers' limitations. In this context, targeting and measuring the effectiveness of digital ads became increasingly difficult, leading to a decline in ROIs for advertisers and any party involved in the digital advertising ecosystem: People receive irrelevant ads, publishers receive less revenue, and advertisers pay more for less.

## The Web3 Era

The advent of Web3 promises a decentralized future, challenging the status quo of digital advertising. While Web3 offers more control over personal data, it lacks a robust advertising model (the funding source of many projects in web2), hindered by privacy concerns and blockchain's immutable nature. Yet, this also opens opportunities for a cryptographic-based advertising model that could revolutionize the industry by balancing decentralization, transparency, privacy, and regulatory compliance, potentially offering better ROIs for advertisers and benefits for all stakeholders.
Current Web3 advertising models only supports targeting based on on-chain data, which is not enough to provide relevant ads, but also impractical since most of the time we don't have the wallet connected (e.g. see etherscan ads). This is because they are managing only public data, while the most valuable data for targeting is private, e.g. Martin saw that NFT but didn't buy it.

## Targecy

Traditional targeting solution 'listens' to users' behaviour and saves their data in a centralized database, which is then used to target them with relevant ads. We are proposing exactly the opposite. Targecy's architecture includes on-chain contracts (transparency - decentralization), an open-source relayer and a third party indexer (privacy - scalability), while the core of the solution is to leave credentials on users' devices, which will be the seed for the targeting algorithm (client-side). Fraud is impossible in Targecy thanks to the verification of zero-knowledge proofs issued client-side from those credentials. This way, we can provide a zero-fraud and robust advertising model that balances decentralization, transparency, privacy, and regulatory compliance, offering better ROIs (based on precise-targeting) for advertisers and therefore more benefits for all stakeholders.
